Exeercise 6  - Error diagnosis

The error is:

NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'
  
To me, it appears that a variable named 'shoes' was declared in an inner scope and then the program tried to access it from an outer scope.
