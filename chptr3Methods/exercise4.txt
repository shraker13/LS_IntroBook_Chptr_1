Exercise 3.4 - More methods

what will the following print to the screen:

*****
  def scream(words)
    words = words + "!!!!"
    return
    puts words
  end

  scream("Yippeee")
*****

It won't print anything to the screen. The explicit return in the method is the last line evaluated, so the puts words is ignored
