Exercise 3.6 - Error evaluation

What does this error tell you:

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
  
It looks like someone created a method called calculate_product that has two parameters, but only one argument was entered.
